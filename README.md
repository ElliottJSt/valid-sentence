# valid-sentence
valid-sentence is my attempt at completing a challenge to create a piece of code that checks if a sentence
is valid based on a series of rules outlined below. It has been written in Python.
## Rules
- String starts with a capital letter.
- String has an even number of quotation marks.
- String ends with one of the following sentence termination characters: ".", "?", "!"
- String has no period character other than the last character.
- Numbers below 13 are spelled out("one, "two", "three", etc...).
## Usage
Once imported, use `check-valid-sentence(input)` to check if a sentence is valid, input must be of
type string.
